- Hello there, I'm Fredrik!

- I have a keen interest in bare-metal programming, network programming, linker
  scripts, compilers, and optimizations in the intersection between software
  and hardware.

- I work for a company that makes phased-array broadband radios for critical
  applications that demand real-time communication.

- I'm passionate about open-source software and open-access research.

- Besides work, I'm into rock climbing, chess, and being outdoors.

- Don't hesitate to reach out, I'm always up for a chat about programming,
  climbing, chess, and what not.
